4. what is git ?

	* is the new fast-rising star of version control systems. Initially developed by Linux kernel creator Linus Torvalds, Git has recently taken the Web development community by storm. Git offers a much different type of version control in that it’s a distributed version control system. With a distributed version control system, there isn’t one centralized code base to pull the code from. Different branches hold different parts of the code. 
	  Other version control systems, such as SVN and CVS, use centralized version control, meaning that only one master copy of the software is used.
   
	
	who invented or developed git?

5. What is Github? 
	
	* is a web-based Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distributed revision control 
	  and source code management (SCM) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
